Writing Files

We can open a file object using the method ** write()** to save the text file to a list. To write the mode, argument must be set to write w. Let’s write a file Example2.txt with the line: “This is line A”

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','w') as writefile:
    writefile.write("This is line A")
We can read the file to see if it worked:

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
We can write multiple lines:

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','w') as writefile:
    writefile.write("This is line A\n")
    writefile.write("This is line B\n")
The method .write() works similar to the method .readline(), except instead of reading a new line it writes a new line. The process is illustrated in the figure , the different colour coding of the grid represents a new line added to the file after each method call.

An example of “.write()”, the different colour coding of the grid represents a new line added after each method call.
You can check the file to see if your results are correct

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
By setting the mode argument to append a you can append a new line as follows:

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','a') as testwritefile:
    testwritefile.write("This is line C\n")
You can verify the file has changed by running the following cell:

with open('/resources/data/Example2.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
We write a list to a .txt file as follows:

Lines=["This is line A\n","This is line B\n","This is line C\n"]
Lines
with open('Example2.txt','w') as writefile:
    for line in Lines:
        print(line)
        writefile.write(line)
We can verify the file is written by reading it and printing out the values:

with open('Example2.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
We can again append to the file by changing the second parameter to a. This adds the code:

with open('Example2.txt','a') as testwritefile:
    testwritefile.write("This is line D\n")
We can see the results of appending the file:

with open('Example2.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
Copy a file
Let's copy the file Example2.txt to the file Example3.txt:

with open('Example2.txt','r') as readfile:
    with open('Example3.txt','w') as writefile:
          for line in readfile:
                writefile.write(line)
We can read the file to see if everything works:

with open('Example3.txt','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
After reading files, we can also write data into files and save them in different file formats like .txt, .csv, .xls (for excel files) etc. Let's take a look at an example.

# Write CSV file example

student_list = [{"Student ID": 1, "Gender": "F", "Name": "Emma"},
       {"Student ID": 2, "Gender": "M", "Name": "John"},
       {"Student ID": 3, "Gender": "F", "Name": "Linda"}]

# Write csv file
with open('Example_csv.csv','w') as writefile:

    # Set header for each column
    for col_header in list(student_list[0].keys()):
        writefile.write(str(col_header) + ", ")
    writefile.write("\n")

    # Set value for each column
    for student in student_list:
        for col_ele in list(student.values()):
            writefile.write(str(col_ele) + ", ")
        writefile.write("\n")

# Print out the result csv
with open('Example_csv.csv','r') as testwritefile:
    print(testwritefile.read())
Now go to the directory to ensure the .txt file exists and contains the summary data that we wrote.
